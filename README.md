### Elevator pitch:

Hello my name is Tiffany Asbell I am a life long learner and not afraid to ask the question why. I am currently a Physical Therapy Assistant and wanting to pivot my career to IT.

#### Intro:

Growing up I had a very skewed perception of what IT was and who worked in the field. I believed it was very dull, working in dimly lit rooms, and involved a lot of Math. My friend’s brother worked a lot with computers fixing them and worked on making his own games. It always seemed very interesting. However, this false perception of what IT was led me to believe I wouldn't enjoy it as a career. I always wanted to help people so I followed a career path that eventually led me to go to school and graduate as a licensed Physical Therapy Assistant. I am now looking to pivot in my career towards one that fosters more of my creative side while still using my years of experience with customer service, public relations and problem solving. After speaking with other program directors that didn’t seem to fit me I found Savvy Coders online and watched a few demo days on Youtube. I was very impressed with the level of care, knowledge and support for the cohort and knew I had the right program. I decided to do my Capstone project on creating a web application called Hidden Oddities. Hidden Oddities is a website culminating information about popular Cryptids here in the US. It gives you the ability to view a bio about each Cryptid, search for sightings in your area, comment on blog posts about others experiences, and a resources page for further research. There are many documentaries and TV shows about Cryptids but is lacking in a web presence that gathers things together. If there's anything you want to know about things that go bump in the night this is the page to use.

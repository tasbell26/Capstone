<strong>Welcome to Hidden Oddities!</strong> The number one spot for all things that go bump in the night. Here you will be able to learn about popular and new found Cryptids that roam the United States and chat with others that have had similar experiences. This site is a culmination of information, first hand accounts and resources for you to explore the oddities that might be lurking in your own back yard. This is an under served demographic of people that are curious about the less loved things in life and where to find them. There are many documentaries, tx shows and movies but very few web pages of this style about Cryptids. So, if you have a story log in and share! Wanna plan a trip? Research the growing list of Cryptids and then hit the go exploring page and plan an adventure!

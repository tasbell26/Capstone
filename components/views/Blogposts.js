      Why would you curse your thirteenth child to be "of the devil"? I mean I
      know people are superstitious about 13 but that's a bit extra. But what's
      craziest is how so many people believed it to be real. I mean they closed
      businesses and schools because of this thing. Maybe they can just make it
      into something fun and cool like the Mothman festival.

      <strong>Welcome to Hidden Oddities!</strong> The number one spot for all
      things that go bump in the night. Here you will be able to learn about
      popular and new found Cryptids that roam the United States and chat with
      others that have had similar experiences. This site is a culmination of
      information, first hand accounts and resources for you to explore the
      oddities that might be lurking in your own back yard. This is an under
      served demographic of people that are curious about the less loved things
      in life and where to find them. There are many documentaries, tx shows and
      movies but very few web pages of this style about Cryptids. So, if you
      have a story log in and share! Wanna plan a trip? Research the growing
      list of Cryptids and then hit the go exploring page and plan an adventure!

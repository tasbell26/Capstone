        <strong>Have you seen the Mothman?</strong>
        The Mothman of Point Pleasant, West Virginia is a creature of infamous
        reputation. That for decades has been the center of fear, speculation
        and surprisingly, tourism to hundreds of locals since the mid 60's.
        First seen following two young couples in their car, to being blamed for
        the Silver Bridge collapse claiming 46 lives. Though the Mothman is
        steeped in mystery it has become an unusual beacon of revenue for the
        town where it hosts a Mothman festival every year in September. In
        recent years it seems Mothman has expanded his territory with sightings
        being reported in Texas and as far as Moscow. With so little known of
        this creature and its ever expanding reach there's no telling where it
        will been seen next. So... Have you seen the Mothman?

        <strong>Bigfoot!</strong> Sasquatch, Yeti, Skunk Ape and The Old Man of
        the Mountain. Most notably of all, Bigfoot! Bigfoot is probably the most
        widely known creature to ever exist. It has been seen all over the world
        from the Alps, to the rain forests of South America. Hundreds of
        sightings all over the United States all with very similar descriptions
        of the creature and all experiencing similar circumstances of
        encounters. So the next time you are out in the woods watch your head.
        Bigfoot is known to throw rocks as a territorial display.

        <strong>Chupacabra killed my goats!</strong>
        Literally translating to "Goat sucker" this is a creature preferring to
        reside in the warmer areas of the SouthWest United States, Mexico, and
        South America. This creature varies in description from dog like to a
        more reptilian Goblin with spines. More than likely this creature can be
        attributed to canines suffering from mange but there is no doubt
        something, is preying on goats and other livestock.

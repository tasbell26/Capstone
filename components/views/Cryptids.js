      <strong>Have you seen the Mothman?</strong>
      <br />
      The Mothman of Point Pleasant, West Virginia is a creature of infamous
      reputation. That for decades has been the center of fear, speculation and
      surprisingly, tourism to hundreds of locals since the mid 60's. First seen
      following two young couples in their car, to being blamed for the Silver
      Bridge collapse claiming 46 lives. Though the Mothman is steeped in
      mystery it has become an unusual beacon of revenue for the town where it
      hosts a Mothman festival every year in September. In recent years it seems
      Mothman has expanded his territory with sightings being reported in Texas
      and as far as Moscow. With so little known of this creature and its ever
      expanding reach there's no telling where it will been seen next. So...
      Have you seen the Mothman?

        <strong>Bigfoot!</strong><br />
        Sasquatch, Yeti, Skunk Ape and The Old Man of the Mountain. Most notably
        of all, Bigfoot! Bigfoot is probably the most widely known creature to
        ever exist. It has been seen all over the world from the Alps, to the
        rain forests of South America. Hundreds of sightings all over the United
        States all with very similar descriptions of the creature and all
        experiencing similar circumstances of encounters. So the next time you
        are out in the woods watch your head. Bigfoot is known to throw rocks as
        a territorial display.

        <strong>Chupacabra killed my goats!</strong><br />
        Literally translating to "Goat sucker" this is a creature preferring to
        reside in the warmer areas of the SouthWest United States, Mexico, and
        South America. This creature varies in description from dog like to a
        more reptilian Goblin with spines. More than likely this creature can be
        attributed to canines suffering from mange but there is no doubt
        something, is preying on goats and other livestock.

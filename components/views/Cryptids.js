          <strong>Have you seen the Mothman?</strong>
          The Mothman of Point Pleasant, West Virginia is a creature of infamous
          reputation. That for decades has been the center of fear, speculation
          and surprisingly, tourism to hundreds of locals since the mid 60's.
          First seen following two young couples in their car, to being blamed
          for the Silver Bridge collapse claiming 46 lives. Though the Mothman
          is steeped in mystery it has become an unusual beacon of revenue for
          the town where it hosts a Mothman festival every year in September. In
          recent years it seems Mothman has expanded his territory with
          sightings being reported in Texas and as far as Moscow. With so little
          known of this creature and its ever expanding reach there's no telling
          where it will been seen next. So... Have you seen the Mothman?

          <strong>Bigfoot!</strong> Sasquatch, Yeti, Skunk Ape and The Old Man
          of the Mountain. Most notably of all, Bigfoot! Bigfoot is probably the
          most widely known creature to ever exist. It has been seen all over
          the world from the Alps, to the rain forests of South America.
          Hundreds of sightings all over the United States all with very similar
          descriptions of the creature and all experiencing similar
          circumstances of encounters. So the next time you are out in the woods
          watch your head. Bigfoot is known to throw rocks as a territorial
          display.

          <strong>Chupacabra killed my goats!</strong>
          Literally translating to "Goat sucker" this is a creature preferring
          to reside in the warmer areas of the SouthWest United States, Mexico,
          and South America. This creature varies in description from dog like
          to a more reptilian Goblin with spines. More than likely this creature
          can be attributed to canines suffering from mange but there is no
          doubt something, is preying on goats and other livestock.

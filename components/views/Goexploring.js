      <p><strong>Don't forget to observe some basic rules of safety:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Be sure to research route and time to complete route well before starting to ensure you won't be caught in the dark. </li>
          <li>Don't forget to bring a map, water, snacks and other items such as a flashlight and bug spray to make your journey more enjoyable.</li>
          <li>Let someone know where you are going and what time you plan to complete your journey to ensure if you become lost help won't be far behind.</li>
          <li>Better yet bring a friend!</li>
          <li>Please be aware of all no trespassing signs and all postings at trails where animals may be in the area.</li>
          <li>Most importantly bring a camera to record all the wonderful things you capture while exploring.</li>
